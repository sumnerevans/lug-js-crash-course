- Objects:
    - Just maps
    - Inheritance
    - Prototype chain
- Functions
    - Objects with source code attached
    - Callbacks
- Scope
    - Closure

# Brief Syntax Overview (stress that JS looks syntactially similar to the C family of languages)
- Variables
    - Types
    - Arrays: Objects with array properties attached
- Control statements

# Pitfalls
- Truthy and Falsy
- `===` vs `==`
- parseInt must have base 10 specified
- @SUMNER: Add more

# Additional Resources
- JavaScript: The Good Parts
- MDN
- Libraries
